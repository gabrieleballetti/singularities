# Study of the singularities arising from minimal polytopes

[K3 Polytopes and their Quartic Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02236.pdf) - Gabriele Balletti, Marta Panizzut, Bernd Sturmfels

Script for the manipulation of polynomials with general coefficients. It progressively applies transformations to polynomials in order to reduce the singularity to a normal form and compare it with the ones characterized by Arnol'd.

The list of minimal polytopes can be found [here](https://github.com/gabrieleballetti/k3_polytopes), in data/minimal.txt.
